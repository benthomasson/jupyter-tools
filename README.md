=========

A library of modules for Ansible Jupyter Kernel.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
        - role: benthomasson.jupyter_tools
      tasks:
        - html_template:
            src: hello.j2
